# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Backend (Express + MongoDB)

Backend code is in `backend/`.

### Setup

1. Create `.env` in `backend/`:

```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/jobfinder
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

2. Install and run:

```
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Health: `GET http://localhost:5000/health`

Jobs API: `http://localhost:5000/api/jobs`

## Deploy backend to Render

We include `render.yaml` for one-click deploy.

Steps:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render, create a new Blueprint from your repo; it will detect `render.yaml`.
3. Set environment variables in the Render service:
   - `MONGODB_URI` = your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `CORS_ORIGIN` = your frontend origin (e.g., `https://your-frontend.onrender.com` or `*` for testing)
4. Deploy. Render builds using `backend/` as `rootDir`, runs `npm run build` then `npm start`.
5. Health check path: `/health` should return `{ status: 'ok' }`.

Frontend note: set `VITE_API_URL` to your Render backend URL and rebuild the frontend.
