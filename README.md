# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Backend (Express + MongoDB)

Backend code is in `backend/`.

### Setup

1. Create `.env` in `backend/`:

```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/jobfinder
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

2. Install and run:

```
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Health: `GET http://localhost:5000/health`

Jobs API: `http://localhost:5000/api/jobs`

## Deploy to Render (Frontend + Backend)

We include `render.yaml` for one-click deploy of both services.

Steps:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Render, create a new Blueprint from your repo; it will detect `render.yaml` and create both services.
3. Set environment variables:

   **Backend service:**
   - `MONGODB_URI` = your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `CORS_ORIGIN` = your frontend Render URL (e.g., `https://jobfinder-frontend.onrender.com`)

   **Frontend service:**
   - `VITE_API_URL` = your backend Render URL (e.g., `https://jobfinder-backend.onrender.com`)

4. Deploy both services. 
   - Backend health check: `/health` should return `{ status: 'ok' }`
   - Frontend will be available at the provided URL

**Note:** After deployment, update the backend's `CORS_ORIGIN` with the actual frontend URL from Render.
